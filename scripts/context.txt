Purpose of scripts/:

    The scripts/ folder contains utilities for one-off or scheduled tasks
    (e.g., pre-fetching OHLCV for config/markets/india/watchlists/master.yaml, corporate action fetching),
    which are executed directly (e.g., python scripts/prefetch_historical_data.py) rather than imported as modules.
    These scripts interact with the core application (src/py/core/, src/py/messaging/)
    but don’t need to be part of the importable module structure.

    A normal folder avoids unnecessary complexity (e.g., maintaining __init__.py) for scripts that don’t require package
    functionality. It separates standalone utilities from the core application code (src/py/), which is organized as a
    package (src/py/__init__.py) for modular imports.
